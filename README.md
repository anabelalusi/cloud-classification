## Introduction
In this project, we propose a machine learning approach to classify cloud types using Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data. Our methodology leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze GHI data and accurately classify different types of clouds.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anabelalusi/cloud-classification.git
cd cloud-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset by organizing your GHI data and corresponding cloud type labels. Ensure your data is in the format expected by the scripts.

## Results
The results of our experiments, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics, can be found in the results directory. Detailed analysis and visualizations are also provided in the paper.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project. Please follow the standard GitHub workflow: fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
